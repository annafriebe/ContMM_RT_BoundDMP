 * @brief   This class contains the implementation for generic probability
 *          solvers for resource reservation tasks. In essence, a probability
 *          solver wraps the different algorithms used to compute probabilistic
 *          deadlines. The solver for resource reservation is one to one linked
 *          with a task.
