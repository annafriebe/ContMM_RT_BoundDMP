 * @brief   This class contains the abstract definitions for probability 
 *          solvers. In essence, a probability solver wraps the different 
 *          algorithms used to compute probabilistic deadlines.
 *          Specific interfaces are also provided for resource reservations 
 *          and fixed priority.
