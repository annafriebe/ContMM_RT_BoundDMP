 * @brief   This class contains the abstract definitions for generic 
 *          probability solvers for resource reservation tasks. In 
 *          essence, a probability solver wraps the different algorithms 
 *          used to compute probabilistic deadlines. The solver for resource 
 *          reservation is one to one linked with a task.
